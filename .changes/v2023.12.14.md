## [December 14, 2023](https://github.com/OpsLevel/kubectl-opslevel/compare/v2022.10.19...v2023.12.14)

MASSIVE REFACTOR:  The entire codebase hasn't been released for over 1 year prior to this release, and thus
we went through a major refactor to ship this release.  That said we intend this release to be functionality 
similar to the previous release and test coverage of the pieces has been increased significantly.  If you do
find any breaking changes please let us know and we will work to fix them.

### Feature
* update go version to 1.21
* Upgraded all dependencies
* Add ability to assign a system to the discovered service
### Deprecated
* Remove the 'account' commands as they have been deprecated
### Refactor
* do not obscure api error responses when doing client validation
* fix an infinite CPU usage bug with the logic in the k8s controller
